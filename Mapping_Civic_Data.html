# Who is voting for &amp;lt;my candidate&gt; ? 🗳

### My first slippy map, for Somerville Alderman elections, 2013

Map of canvassing data
👣 using Leaflet.js.
Shows location of supporters, non-supporters, not reached, etc.

Non-public data, sorry! 🤦‍♂️

# Cambridge Open Data portal launch 🚀

### 2015 - We have data...

Jan Devereux (FPRA president, now City Councilor) suggested that FPRA might need a “data person”. I volunteered. 😃

Coincidentally, &lt;img src="http://leafletjs.com/docs/images/logo.png" alt="Leaflet logo" style="height: 25px;"/&gt; for R was released around the same time. 

### ⛈️ ⚡ A perfect storm ⚡ ⛈️

# Let's explore! 🔎

# Who owns Cambridge?

## 🏛 Institutional ownership of Cambridge property

- Based on assessor's data and parcel map (the first of many)
- Each parcel links to assessor's property page

### Issues

- Spelling - At least __7__ ways to spell  
  __`PRESIDENT &amp; FELLOWS OF HARVARD COLLEGE`__
- Linking to property page via map-lot was problematic
- City staff were _very_ helpful with
  - understanding mysterious codes
  - updating the [Property Database](http://www.cambridgema.gov/propertydatabase/) website to support map-lot links

# Where are the most valuable residential properties?

### An exploration of property values 💰

### [Top 100 Residential Properties map](http://kentsj.com/FPRA/Top100Residential.html)

- Updated for 2018 data, preserving the (crude) style
- Most field names changed from 2015 to 2018 🙁

---

# Seriously, now... 🤔

---

# Where is Cambridge Affordable Housing?

### An attempt to map all affordable housing in Cambridge

### Ultimately a failure 🤷‍♀️

- Many, many owners 👴🏼 👴🏿 👨🏽 👨🏾‍⚕️ 👨🏽 👨‍🎓 👨🏻‍⚕️ 👴🏿 👴🏻 👨🏻‍⚕️
- No centralized data source
- What counts as affordable, anyway?

# Who can create Accessory Housing? 🏘️

### Combridge 2015 accessory housing ordinance was very restrictive.

### Limitations on lot size, building size, zone, etc.

#### How many properties might qualify for an accessory unit?

#### How could changes in the ordinance increase availability?

[Interactive application](http://kentsj.com/FPRA/AccessoryHousing.html)
made with [R](http://r-project.org) and [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) allows
exploration of eligible properties as the limitations
are changed.

Resulted in a change to the Cambridge zoning ordinance! 🎉

---

# Where are non-conforming lots?

### OK, where are lots with less than 20' frontage? 📐

### Creating [this map](http://kentsj.com/FPRA/SmallFrontage.html) required extensive geospatial processing.

- Buffer roads and sidewalks
- Split parcels into segments
- Segments fully in the buffer are frontage segments

#### [Cambridge GIS](http://gis.cambridgema.gov) has _many_ useful datasets, yay!

---

# How will the Cambridge Lighting Ordinance affect me?

### Changes proposed to allowable outdoor lighting 💡 🚨 🏮

### Who is affected?

[Map](http://kentsj.com/LZ/ProposedLightingZones.html) based on existing zoning and proposed changes was used as part of a
campaign for a stronger ordinance.

Simple geospatial analysis to find areas of the zones and length of the border between zones.

# Who is building in the Alewife area?

### The Alewife region has been extensively developed in the past ten years 🏘 🏢 🏨

### There is no end in sight.

[Alewife Development Map](http://kentsj.com/FPRA/Alewife_Projects.html) combines

- curated development information
- parcel map
- overlays for flood plain, tree cover, parking

to shine light on development in this sensitive area.

---

# Where is Alewife tax revenue? 💵

### Alewife development has not caused a similar increase in revenue.

### Why not?

#### [Tax Revenue Report](http://kentsj.com/FPRA/AlewifeTaxRevenue.html) shows increase in valuation and taxes over six years.

Acquiring data for six years was difficult:

- Changing data format - different data, different names
- Missing data - residential exemption was supplied separately or not at all
- Mangled data - data in the wrong columns required detective work and fixup
- Auxiliary data - historical tax rates

---

# Where are SeeClickFix requests? 🔧

### [SeeClickFix](https://seeclickfix.com/cambridge) allows citizens to request services and report problems.

#### Original goal was to track tree planting requests. 🌳

#### Result is an [interactive app](http://kentsj.com/FPRA/SeeClickFix.html) showing stats on open and closed requests, and the location of open requests.

Data is pulled from the Open Data Portal as needed using the Socrata API.

### OK 😁
